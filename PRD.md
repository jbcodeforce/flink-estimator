# Product Requirements Document: Flink Estimator

## 1. Introduction

The Flink Estimator is a web-based tool designed to help users estimate the resource requirements for their Confluent Platform for Flink jobs. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting job parameters and generates resource estimations to optimize cluster utilization and prevent job failures.

## 2. Problem Statement

Accurately estimating the resources (CPU, memory, parallelism) for an Apache Flink job is a complex task. Over-provisioning leads to wasted resources and increased costs, while under-provisioning can cause performance degradation and job failures. This project aims to provide a data-driven and user-friendly solution to this problem.

## 3. Goals

*   To provide a simple and intuitive web interface for users to describe their Flink jobs.
*   To generate accurate resource estimations based on user inputs and a predefined model.
*   To allow users to save, view, and manage their past estimations.
*   To provide a RESTful API for programmatic access to the estimation functionality.
*   To ensure the application is easily deployable and scalable, with support for containerization and Kubernetes.

## 4. Target Audience

*   **Data Engineers:** Who design and develop Flink jobs.
*   **Platform Engineers:** Who manage and operate Flink clusters.
*   **DevOps Engineers:** Who are responsible for deploying and scaling Flink applications.

## 5. Features

### 5.1. Web-based User Interface

*   **Home Page:** A landing page that provides a brief introduction to the tool.
*   **Estimation Page:** A form where users can input the parameters of their Flink job, such as the number of sources, sinks, operators, and expected data volume.
*   **Results Page:** A page that displays the results of the estimation, including recommended CPU, memory, and parallelism settings.
*   **Saved Estimations Page:** A page where users can view and manage their saved estimations.

### 5.2. Estimation Engine

*   A core component that takes Flink job parameters as input and calculates the estimated resource requirements.
*   The estimation logic will be based on a combination of heuristics and configurable parameters.

### 5.3. Saved Estimations

*   Users can save their estimations for future reference.
*   Each saved estimation will be stored with a unique ID and a user-provided name.

### 5.4. RESTful API

*   The application will expose a RESTful API for programmatic access to the estimation engine.
*   The API will allow users to submit estimation requests and retrieve the results in JSON format.

## 6. Technical Requirements

*   **Backend:** Python with the FastAPI framework.
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Jinja2 for templating.
*   **Containerization:** The application will be containerized using Docker.
*   **Deployment:** The application will be deployable on Kubernetes.

## 7. Future Work

*   **Advanced Estimation Models:** Incorporate machine learning models to improve the accuracy of the estimations based on historical data.
*   **Integration with Monitoring Systems:** Integrate with monitoring systems like Prometheus to gather real-time metrics from Flink clusters and use them to refine the estimations.
*   **Support for Different Deployment Modes:** Add support for different Flink deployment modes, such as YARN and Mesos.
*   **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization to provide a personalized experience and secure access to saved estimations.
